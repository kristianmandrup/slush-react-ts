# Slush React Native TypeScript generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kristianmandrup/slush-react-ts.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kristianmandrup/slush-react-ts) [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/slush-react-ts.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/slush-react-ts)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/kristianmandrup/slush-react-ts.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Use this generator to create a basic React Native app with
TypeScript support (ie. [TSX](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/JSX)).

This generator is based on the seed project [ReactNativeTS](https://github.com/mrpatiwi/ReactNativeTS)

For info on using [TSX](http://www.jbrantly.com/typescript-and-jsx/)

### Editor/IDE

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
with plugins:

- [React Native](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native).
- [React Native code-push](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)

Be sure to follow [VSC Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/Updates)

## Getting Started

Install `slush-react-ts` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-react-ts
```

### Usage: React Native

The `default` generator configures a React Native app for TypeScript

Create a *react-native* app using the CLI app generator:

```bash
projects $ react-native init my-app
```

Run the slush generator from within the folder of your react-native app:

```bash
projects $ cd my-app
my-app $ slush react-ts
```

The generator will:

1. Delete the default generated `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js`
2. Create 


```bash
/src
    /native
        /components
    index.ios.tsx
    index.android.tsx
```

Your TypeScript config should then be configured to compile all files in `/src` folder to a target folder such as `build`.

### Troubleshooting

If you get the error `You must run this generator inside a project created with react-native-cli` make sure you are running the generator from a folder with an `ios` or `android` folder (or both).

These folders contain the native parts of your app for each supported native environment. The folders are (usually) generated by `react-native` CLI app generator)

Make sure you have a recent (2016+) `react-native-cli` binary installed globally. We recommend using version `0.1.10` or higher

```bash
$ npm view react-native-cli version
0.1.8
```

Install `react-native-cli`

```
$ npm uninstall -g react-native-cli
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Sub generators

Currently we have TypeScript sub-generators for:
- `redux` : configure app for using Redux
- `redux-model` : create full Redux domain model setup
- `webpack` : configure webpack
- `web` : create react web app

Usage example: `$ slush react-ts:redux`

Feel free to suggest and contribute with more/better generators!

### Redux

Configures the `src` folder for Redux as follows:

```bash
/flux
    /actions
        /__spec__
    /constants
    /models
    /reducers
        /__spec__
        rootReducer.ts

/native
    /components
    /containers

/web
    /components
    /containers
```

The `__spec__` folders contain specs (tests).

### Redux model

1. Asks for a model name (default: `todo`)
2. Asks for platforms to generate for (`web`, `native`)

For a `todo` model, it will create the following flux files:

```bash
/flux
    /actions
        /__spec__
            todos-spec.ts
        todos.ts
    /constants
        todos.ts
    /models
        todos.ts
    /reducers
        /__spec__
          todos-spec.ts
        todos.ts
```

For `native` platform

```bash
/native
    /components
        TodoItem.tsx
        TodoList.tsx
    /containers
        TodoContainer.tsx
```

Similar layout for the `web` platform.  

*Web*
`TodoList` will render a `ul` DOM element

*Native*
`TodoList` renders a `ListView` of the domain model with a data source (using mock data). 

On any platform, `TodoList` will render each row using a `TodoItem` component, passing the row data into `props` using spread operator.
