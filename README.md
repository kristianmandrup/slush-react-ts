# Slush React Native TypeScript generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/kristianmandrup/slush-react-ts-generator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kristianmandrup/slush-react-ts-generator) [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/slush-react-ts-generator.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/slush-react-ts-generator)

Use this generator to create a basic React Native app with 
TypeScript support (ie. [TSX](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/JSX)).

This generator is based on the seed project [ReactNativeTS](https://github.com/mrpatiwi/ReactNativeTS)

For info on using [TSX](http://www.jbrantly.com/typescript-and-jsx/)

### Editor/IDE

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
with plugins:

- [React Native](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native). 
- [React Native code-push](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push)

Be sure to follow [VSC Updates](https://code.visualstudio.com/Updates)

## Getting Started

Install `slush-react-ts-generator` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-react-ts-generator
```

### Usage: React Native

The `default` generator configures a React Native app for TypeScript

Create a react-native app:

```bash
projects $ react-native init my-app
```

Run the generator from within the folder of the react-native app:

```bash
projects $ cd my-app
my-app $ slush react-ts
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get the error `You must run this generator inside a project created with react-native-cli` make sure you are running the generator from a folder with either an `ios` or `android` folder (or both). 

These folders contain the native parts of your app for each supported native environment. The folders are (usually) generated by `react-native` CLI app generator)

Make sure you have a recent (2016+) `react-native-cli` binary installed globally.

```bash
$ npm uninstall -g react-native-cli
$ npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Sub generators

Currently we have TypeScript sub-generators for:
- `redux` : configure app for using Redux
- `redux-model` : create full Redux domain model setup
- `webpack` : configure webpack
- `web` : create react web app

Usage example: `$ slush react-ts:redux`

Feel free to suggest and contribute with more/better generators!

Note: These generators are WIP (under development/testing) so you might encounter bugs.

### Redux

Configures the `src` folder for Redux as follows:

```bash
/actions
    /__spec__
/components
/constants
/containers
    App.tsx
/models
/reducers
    /__spec__
    rootReducer.ts
```

The `__spec__` folders contain your specs/tests

### Redux model

Asks for a model name (default: `todo`)
For a `todo` model, it will create the following files:

```bash
/actions
    /__spec__
        todos-spec.ts
    todos.ts
/components
    TodoItem.tsx
    TodoList.tsx
/constants
    todos.ts
/containers
    TodoContainer.tsx
/models
    todos.ts
/reducers
    /__spec__
      todos-spec.ts
    todos.ts
```
